(00:01)
The Federalist Papers were authored as an explanation for why it is the states should adopt the Constitution.

(02:08)
The US Republic's Senate is like the Senates of the Republics of Athens and Rome.
Every Republic has fallen because of partisanship and become totalitarian.

(03:42)
We can't trade liberty for security because Ben Franklin said so.
Events before the revolution against Great Britain are irrelevant because we left Great Britain.
We could consider events before the revolution to be relevant, but only if we had established a monarch, like Britain.

(04:52)
Our liberties are enumerated in the Bill of the Rights.
Freedom of speech is the first liberty in the bill of rights.
Freedom of speech is the most important liberty.
"Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech."
Freedom of speech is the ability to have free and robust debate and political speech.

(05:41)
Something that Mr. Raskin and his team brought up is tknhat it’s somehow a suggestion from former President Trump’s team that when various public officials were not denouncing the violence that we saw all over the summer that that was somehow … The former president equating that speech to his own.
Not at all.
Exactly backwards.
There exists a Representative who walked back comments she had made, but I can't remember what it was about.
This Representative should have the freedom to say that Trump supporters do not merit consideration of their ideas, and anyone should be allowed to say they agree.

(07:03)
We revolted against Great Britain in order to speak freely in the most robust political debate.
I don’t expect and I don’t believe that the former president expects anybody to walk back any of the language.
If that’s how they feel about the way things transpired over the last couple of years in this country, they should be allowed to say that and I will go to court and defend them if anything happens to them as a result.
If the government acts against [that state representative] or US Representative, she deserves to be defended in court.

(08:07)
This trial is not about trading liberty for security.
It’s about suggesting that it is a good idea that we give up those liberties that we have so long fought for.
We have sent armies to other parts of the world to convince those governments to implement the freedoms that we enjoy.
This trial is about trading liberty for the security from the mob? Honestly, no.
It can’t be.
We can’t be thinking about that.
We can’t possibly be suggesting that we punish people for political speech in this country.

(09:03)
We punish people for political speech in this country.
And if people go and commit lawless acts as a result of their beliefs, they should be locked up.
Some Capitol rioters are being charged with conspiracy.
Trump is not being charged with conspiracy. He is probably not being charged with conspiracy because there is not probable cause to charge him with conspiracy.

(10:29)
But the political pendulum will shift one day.
Partisan impeachments will become commonplace.
You know, until the impeachment of Bill Clinton, no one alive had ever lived through a presidential impeachment, not unless some of you are 150 years old.
Not a single person alive had lived through a presidential impeachment.
Now, most of us have lived through three of them.
Impeachment is supposed to be a rarely used last resort.

(11:40)
Convicting Trump will be the start of a slippery slope of partisan impeachments.

(13:34)
For example, Eric Holder might be impeached by a Republican-led House, or anybody sufficiently skilled or politically worrisome to Republicans.

(14:24)
This could happen in as soon as 2 years.

(14:50)
Representatives who don't want to engage in partisan impeachments will have to worry about challenges from opponents who say they will.

(15:22)
Senators will also face such challenges.
Senator Sasse is facing backlash for his recent vote. (presumption: the 1/6 and 1/7 votes against objecting to PA and AZ electors?)

(15:52)
You know, it’s interesting because I don’t want to steal the thunder from the other lawyers, but Nebraska, you’re going to hear, is quite a judicial thinking place, and just maybe, Senator Sasse is onto something.
And you’ll hear about what it is that the Nebraska courts have to say about the issue that you all are deciding this week.
There seem to be some pretty smart jurist in Nebraska and I can’t believe a United States Senator doesn’t know that.

(16:28)
Only the US Senate can prevent the infighting that ended the Greek and Roman Republics.

(17:18)
This is the second impeachment within 13 months.
The Senate will not be able to accomplish anything other than trying impeachments.

(18:01)
All you Senators agree that all you Senators are patriots.
And that is why this attack on the Constitution will not prevail.
The article of impeachment that is before you is flawed.
Senate Rule 23 states that "Such documents cannot be divided."

(19:33)
The House Managers have made too bold a claim.
Rule 23 states “The article of impeachment’s indivisible.”
This means Senators cannot vote to convict unless they believe all assertions made by the article of impeachment. 

(20:47)
The argument about the 14th Amendment is absolutely ridiculous.
The House Managers tell you that, “The president should be impeached because he violated the 14th Amendment.”

(22:09)
The 14th Amendment was written with former Confederates military and political officials in mind.
The 14th Amendment only applies to those criminally convicted of insurrection.
Donald Trump has not been criminally convicted of insurrection.

(22:59)
The House Managers made a good statement.
The House Managers are afraid.
Most Representatives fear the American people.

(24:09)
The House is impeaching Trump because they do not want to face Donald Trump as their political rival in the future.
Jurisdiction must be established before an impeached official can be removed.

(24:34)
So nobody says it that plainly, but unfortunately I have a way of speaking that way.
And the reason that I am having trouble with the argument is the American people just spoke and they just changed administrations.
So in the light most favorable to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle here, their system works.
The people are smart enough, in the light most favorable to them, they’re smart enough to pick a new administration if they don’t like the old one and they just did.
And he’s down there at Pennsylvania Avenue now, probably wondering, “How come none of my stuff is happening up at the Capitol?”

(25:26)
Why do the members of the House of Representatives and the majority of the House of Representatives, why are they afraid of the very people that sent them to do this job? The people they hope will continue to send them back here.
Why are they afraid that those same people who were smart enough to pick them as their congressmen aren’t smart enough to pick somebody who is a candidate for president of the United States? Why fear that the people will all of a sudden forget how to choose an administration in the next few years?

(26:08)
There have been several one-term presidents who were replaced by the populace, including Nixon (1.5 terms), Ford, Carter, and Bush.

(26:41)
Perhaps the House is worried that Trump will be elected in 2024.

(27:03)
100% of the time in the United States, when the people had been fed up with and had enough of the occupant of The White House, they changed the occupant of the white house.

According to Senator Manchin, the Senate is obligated to be bipartisan.
The Constitution protects the minority, not the majority.
Congress shall make no law abridging the things that were of concern during the Revolution.
It’s easy to be in favor of liberty, and equality, and free speech when it’s popular.
Establishing jurisdiction is the first step of trying this impeachment.

(30:49)
“Judgements in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust, profit under the United States: but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to the law.”
Presidents can be impeached for actions taken in January before the end of their term.
The phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" in the Constitution means "felonies and misdemeanors".
If Trump commited a felony or misdemeanor he can/should be arrested after his term.

(32:09)
A President is accountable for their actions in the final January of their term.
The Department of Justice has the power to criminally charge Trump but has not.
None of the rioters are facing charges of conspiring with Trump.
The punishment for being convicted in an impeachment trial is just removal from office.
The Senate can't punish Trump for what he was impeached for because he is no longer in office.
